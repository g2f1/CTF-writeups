**CTF or Capture The Flag**, the well known competition made by hackers for hackers. The goal is to solve a challenge to get a precious string with a special format called the flag and submit it to get points that will lead you to glory. In a CTF competition, many challenge categories exist; from hard ones like cryptography, pwn, DFIR/Forensics, RE and more to some stupid shit categories that require no skills like OSINT.

In this repo I will share writeups for every challenge — obviously not posting writeups for the silly ~~OSINT~~ — I solved and found interesting to share.
Most of the time you will find challenges related to **cryptography**. Yeah I know, crypto gives headaches. but don’t worry, I’ll do my best to simplify the solving process so the only one getting a headache is me.

Enjoy
